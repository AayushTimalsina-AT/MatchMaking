            Let’s move back to the story. The life was going on with a lot of excitement. Every day I was experiencing
            something new in love. One of her cousins was going to get married soon. She used to talk to her fiancé in
            the evening at every alternate day. It was the day of her cousin’s engagement ceremony. She called me in
            evening, “Hi dear, do you know I am with my cousin and today is her engagement ceremony.” I replied, “Ok
            that’s good dear”. She said amazingly, “Her fiancé is so smart, slim and handsome. I was astonished on
            seeing him”. I asked, “Why dear?” She asked, “Are you also smart and handsome?” I replied in a low tone,
            “Yes dear.” I was shocked. She was comparing me to her brother-in-law, that’s natural human tendency but how
            could I react to that. I was not at all slim. I was fatty. I was thinking that she had lots of expectations
            and what would happen the day she would meet me, whole of her expectations would dash to ground. But how
            could I tell her the truth. I was again in a dilemma what to do and what not to. She frequently used to tell
            me about her cousins’ fiancé. I could never react to that. One day when I called her, her cousin asked her
            that who had called, she told her that it was her friends call. So, she was in the process of telling her
            family about me. It was the mid of November. She called me, “Who are you?” I replied, “I am Sonia’s Sameer”
            She said, “I am her sister, not Sonia, how do you know Sonia?” I replied, “I love her and want to marry
            her.” She asked, “How did you meet her?” I replied, “I love her, she was my friends’ friend, and we have not
            seen each other as yet.” 35 But it was Sonia only. She said, “Don’t ever say this thing to my sister or any
            other member of my family. Tell them that we met in university. It seems strange that we love each other and
            have not seen each other as yet; everyone would make fun of our love. Whenever you happen to talk to my
            family, just tell them that we met in university. It’s a lie but we will have to do that so that our love is
            not laughed at.” Generally, in love two people meet each other and then fall in love but in our case, it was
            totally different. We had never seen each other still we loved each other by heart and love each other’s
            voice. She used to talk to her cousin’s fiancé and discuss with me ever thing about her conversation with
            him and every time asked me a question, “Are you also like him?” Generally, the girls compare their
            boyfriends and husband to others‟ boyfriends or husbands. Whenever she found him wrong on any account she
            used to ask me whether I also do the same and if my answer was yes then she tried to make me amend the same.
            One day she called me and said “You know! My cousin is trying to call her fiancé for last few hours and his
            phone is busy for such a long time. What can be the reason? Any guesses?” “No dear, how could I?” I replied.
            “He might be having a girlfriend, so busy with talking to her. I will have to tell about it to my uncle so
            that he can reconsider about marriage” she said angrily. “No dear, he might be busy with some work. Don’t
            jump to any conclusion in haste as it may affect their relation.” I said “Poor girl, she is in trap of that
            guy” she said angrily. “Why are you thinking negatively, and you seem to be a very narrow-minded girl” I
            said. “Oh, mind your language, you are also like him, you might also be having a girlfriend. If it really
            happens then I will kill you definitely” she cut the call angrily. I was stunned on hearing that, but also
            felt secured that she was possessive about me. She was little bit narrow minded. 36 I had also started
            drinking occasionally which was known just to my friends only. Next day I called her and said, “How you are
            dear and how is your cousin?” “She is fine. Yesterday you stopped me from doing a foolish thing, I am
            thankful to you, he was busy in his office work that is why his phone was busy, Thank God, I did not do that
            otherwise no one could forgive me ever.” She said with a sigh of relief. “You should always take suggestions
            from me.” I replied with smile. “Ok. But tell me one thing, do you drink?” she asked with suspicion. “What?
            Are you mad? No one in my family drinks and none of the previous generations have ever.” I replied angrily.
            “Ok, but you know my cousin’s fiancé drinks, so bad” she said. “Yeah, it is bad to drink” I said in a low
            tone. But the scene was totally different. I used to drink on weekends with my friends and I kept it secret
            from my family and from my beloved Sonia also. Thinks kept going on like that. I used to make plans with her
            for our life after marriage. We frequently talked about that. Here I want to share something. It was my
            examination time in December, I was preparing for my examination next day. She gave me a miss call but I
            didn’t respond as I was busy. Then she called me and said, “Where were you? Forget me if you don’t want to
            talk to me”. “No dear. Tomorrow is my examination, so I was preparing for that” I replied. “But don’t forget
            me, I am also important to you” she said emotionally. “Ok dear. What’s going on? Have you taken dinner” I
            asked her? “Yeah, take care of yourself” she said “Ok, when I will be with you, you will take care of me” I
            said. “Ok, but I would stay at my mother’s place after marriage. I would marry you, if you agree to it” she
            said. “Ok dear. I will allow you to go to your mother’s place on weekends. So, you can be with her for two
            days a week.” I said. 37 “No, I will go for 3 days a week and daily after my office hours I will go to meet
            my mother first and then will come home. Is it ok?” She said with a cunning smile. “I agree, I will tell you
            everything after marriage” I replied. “You might change after marriage and will forget all this, it happens
            in every love marriage” she said. “Do not worry, I will keep my word.” I replied. “But I feel scared on the
            thought that if our marriage does not happen then what will I do” she said emotionally and then she cut the
            call after saying bye to me. I also got little bit disturbed on hearing that, this thing literally haunted
            me. I knew the future of our relationship by my intuition. But I took it lightly and thought that whatever
            destined, would happen. If destiny is to be with her then we will get married, if not then I would get
            someone better than her. She was much concerned about me and my health. She asked me to do yoga daily and
            used to enquire about the time when I did that. I was not regular in doing it but I used to lie to her even
            if I had not done yoga. Here I would narrate one incident, which I think was the worst on my part. She
            called me at 8 in the evening, “Hi moto(fatty), how are you? I have called you to tell that baba Ramdev
            (yoga guru) is coming to Amritsar next week, you see him there and ask him about your health. Can you go?” I
            got little frustrated and replied, “Ok I will, if you insist”. I wanted to show her that I was doing so many
            things for her. I wanted to make her so much emotional for me as I felt good in that. “Thank you dear. I
            will give you the phone number so that you can contact him. I hope you will get well, and it would be the
            happiest thing for me in my life as I will get what I have desired for” she replied in an emotional tone.
            “Janu, don’t worry, everything would be all right. I will go there”, I replied. Now it was the day when I
            once again lied to her. I told her that I had registered myself for yoga in Amritsar. On the day I was
            supposed to be in Amritsar, I did not take her calls as I had told her that I was in Amritsar for the yoga
            session. She called me so many times. I was in the hostel with my friend and he kept on asking me to pick
            the 38 phones. But I told him that it was of my girlfriend and I had lied to her that I was in Amritsar for
            a yoga camp, so I could not take the call. I would call her later to tell her that I was busy in yoga camp.
            After some time, I called her, she asked so many questions to me, “Hi moto, where were you? Did you attend
            the camp? What did he say? “Yeah, I attended that and that’s why I could not take your call. It was a huge
            gathering there and babaji was not approachable. But I had a talk with his followers and they told me about
            a few exercises”. I lied with confidence. “What they did they tell you? How much time will it take to cure?
            Have they prescribed any medicine? She asked “Yes dear, they told me about the exercise only. They told me
            that that I will get well if I exercise regularly” I said “Good, now I will instruct you when to do and how
            to do. I will watch it on TV and will let you know. I will call you in evening dear. May God bless you with
            good health, I daily pray to God for that. God has not been so kind to me but if this time it does not
            happen then I will never pray. Tell me one thing, you are in Amritsar but the noise in your background is
            the same as it is in your hostel. Are you really in Amritsar” She asked suspiciously. “Dear, I am in my
            friends’ hostel and all hostels are the same, that’s why you are hearing same type of noise. Do you trust
            me?” I lied with confidence. “Yeah dear I trust you.” She cut the call in an emotional tone. I also got
            emotional as I was feeling that she cared so much for me and I lied to her so many times, especially about
            the matters concerned with my health. I was in tears, but I was also helpless. I was going through a grave
            emotional phase, so was not able to tell her the truth. Now I felt a new energy in my body. I started doing
            yoga regularly. Though I lied to her yet felt that if Savitri could bring her husband’s soul back from
            Yamraj, then my problem not being that severe could also be cured with her prayers. I was feeling new energy
            and was optimistic that I would be alright. It went on like that for days. It was the month of December and
            we had vacations for few days, so I was going home. 39 Usually we talked about our love but never ever
            thought of discussing anything related to physical relations. One day while talking to her I said, “Kiss you
            dear much”. She cut the call. I called her back, but she did not answer the call. When I kept on calling her
            again and again she finally took my call and said, “Listen, I don’t want to talk to you, you say such
            things, I don’t like this, I am not like other girls”. I said sorry to her. I realized that she was a bit
            narrow minded, but I still loved her more than anything else. She had a friend named Shivali who was working
            in the same office as her. I used to talk to her frequently. She used to address me as bhaiya and Sonia as
            bhabhi. I felt great on hearing that. It was December 2006 and my semester were over and we had vacations
            now. Before I left for Jammu she called me and said “Hi dear, I want a favor from you. Dear when Shivali’s
            boyfriend asked me about you I told him that you are studying master’s in engineering, he was astonished
            that how could I have such an educated and intelligent guy as my boyfriend. He seems to be jealous of you
            and also asked me to show your photograph. Can you send your photograph to me? I want to show it to him so
            that they believe that you are my boyfriend. Please send it at the earliest to me” she said. I did not know
            how to react to that as I was fatty, and she disliked fatty persons. So, I thought of an idea. I took my
            identity card and scanned it and search for the photoshop editor for editing my picture. Somehow, I was
            successful in doing that. I cropped my photograph to look slim. It was not right on my part as I was again
            lying to her, but I didn’t want to lose her. I did send her that. Next day she called me and said, “What
            type of photograph have you sent to me? I don’t want to talk to you as everyone made fun of me at my office;
            I was very much ashamed of that”. “Dear I don’t have any camera. As you were in hurry yesterday, so I did
            send that only to you, but next time I will send the proper photograph to you. Don’t worry dear”, I replied.
            “You are a liar, I don’t want to talk to you, don’t talk to me”, she replied angrily and put off the call.
            40 I was feeling guilty as I had lied to her, made fun of her trust but she was everything to me and I never
            thought of my life without her. Days passed and now it was vacation time. She frequently called me on my way
            to Jammu. I was feeling good. I was at home in the evening. The first thing I did was to message her to tell
            that I had reached home safely. I enjoyed the meal cooked by my mother; I was eating it almost after six
            months. At around 8 in evening she gave a miss calls on my landline phone, for 5 or 6 times. My mother
            wondered that who was that crazy person but how could I tell her that this crazy person was everything to me
            and I have made her a part of my life. I talked to her after that and she said, “Listen, I will ask my
            brother to meet you in your next visit to Jammu so that decision about our marriage is taken.” I was mute on
            hearing that as I was sure of losing her when anyone from her family or she would meet me. But still in some
            corner of my heart there was a faith in destiny and God that this time He would not be so unfair to me, if
                he existed somewhere in the universe.</p> <br>
