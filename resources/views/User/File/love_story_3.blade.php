            I not only loved her but was greatly obsessed with her love. Whenever she talked about her marriage I got
            highly disturbed as even the thought of that shivered me. She often insisted me to do something about my
            health as otherwise she would get married somewhere else. But I only gave her assurance. Sometimes I
            wondered whether she really loved me or not? In hostel we used to enjoy a lot and even my love story was
            known to everyone as I was always occupied with her calls and thoughts. My friend, Anil whose sister was
            Sonia’s colleague often insisted me to leave her as she didn’t love me. One day Sonia’s colleague Sujata who
            happened to be Anil’s friend talked to Anil at night. A cunning idea came into my mind as in hostel boys
            often used to make fun with each other. After Anil and Sujata finished their chat I messaged Sujata from his
            mobile, “I love you dear, I love you more than anything else, I can’t live without you”. Then I deleted the
            message from the list of sent items. After some time, Anil asked me about that, but I out rightly denied
            that I had sent any message. He asked me many times as he doubted that I might have sent some vulgar message
            to her. On being asked repeatedly I told him about the message I had sent. But he didn’t agree to that. He
            still doubted and warned me of the dire consequences in anger. Next day I got a call from Sonia, “I don’t
            want to continue my relationship with you anymore”. I asked in distress, “What happened dear?” “I wanted you
            to meet everyone in my office as my future husband, but now you have downgraded your reputation as Anil’s
            sister has told me many things about you which are very disgusting, and I don’t like such a person to be my
            husband”. I was very much worried as I had never done such a thing. I enquired about that. Finally, she told
            me, “Anil’s sister has told everyone in my office about you and about your health also. Everyone asks me
            about you. She has also told that we meet frequently and that you have sent some vulgar message to Sujata.
            Everyone is asking me about all this. You lied to Anil about our relation. Tell me where we met. I don’t
            want to continue my relationship with a liar”. “Dear, I never said this to Anil. He does not get well along
            with me and it a lie made by Anil, please try to understand me”. “No, I don’t want any relation with you”
            she said angrily and put the call off. I was in tears as didn’t know how to convince her and I feared losing
            her. I could not sleep that night and next day tried to contact her, but she didn’t take my calls. I was in
            distress for next three days. It was affecting my studies but at that time the most important matter for me
            was my love and not my studies. I was not able to perform my routine work even. I begged of her many times.
            Finally, she put one condition that I should call her when I would be alright and not before that. It was
            very hard for me. I begged of her then at last she agreed on the condition that Sujata and Anil’s sister
            should apologize in front of everyone and confess that whatever they said was a lie. It was hard for me but
            somehow, I convinced Anil to make Sujata to do that. But now I was fed up with all those things. I had to
            give explanation for everything. What was my fault that I had a physical problem? Didn’t I have the right to
            be loved? Sometimes I felt that she talked to me just out of pity for me. I was feeling as if I was living
            on her mercy. I came to know through Anil that Sonia told Sujata that she didn’t love me. She talked to me
            simply because she pitied me and feared that I would do something unusual if she stopped talking to me. I
            was really fed up. I discussed with my friends Santa and Praveen about that. They suggested me to give her
            up as I was playing with my future for the sake of a girl who never loved me but was just passing her time.
            So, I decided that I would try to make a distance from her and rather try to divert my mind towards my
            studies. So, I reduced the frequency of talking to her. I wanted to get rid of the addiction of talking to
            her. It was very difficult for me but somehow, I was successful in that as I knew one day or other she would
                be out of my life. </p>
