               It was the 3rd April 2009 at 8:34 pm, I received a message from my school time friend Sonam “I am going to
            United States today, I will talk to you once I reach there, take care”. I was in deep thought as what she
            wants to tell me, as she never sends me message like that. It seems something very urgent and maybe it is
            concerned with my life. She was my school time friend and married to a software engineer. She was working in
            a software company in Delhi. As her husband had been transferred to US and she was going to join him there.
            It seems that the message had been sent from airport only. Next day was a usual day for me. I simply forgot
            about her message too. At around 8:30 pm she gave me a call and said “Hi Sameer, how are you? I was in hurry
            that day, so I simply sent you a message, because I was boarding flight to US. I want to tell you something
            which seems to be very important in your life”. I was excited “What? Please tell me, I am dying to hear what
            you want to say.” She replies “I had been in Jammu for few days. I met Sonia’s sister. She is going to marry
            in the mid-April and she was busy in preparations for the same. Please forget about her as she is going to
            be someone else’s wife now”. I became mute for a moment. It seemed as if someone has taken heart away from
            my body, as if I was a body without soul, a warrior defeated in the battle of life. I was in tears, my
            heartbeat increased, and it seemed as if my heart will come out of my body. She asked me, “Are you there
            Sameer? What has happened to you? Are you alright?” “Yeah, I am alright. When is she going to be married and
            what her fiancé does?” I asked in great despair. “Well I don’t know more details about that, but Sonia works
            in a Delhi and her fiancé is also in Delhi and also he is from southern part of India” She replied. It
            reminded me of her reluctance to talk to her family based on caste as in her view her family had orthodox
            views in matters related to caste. But, what about her marriage to a person, who was not only of different
            caste but belonged to a very different 3 culture also. Why her orthodox family did not object to her
            marriage with that boy. I have many questions to ask Why she was not hesitant is talking about that guy with
            her family??????????? Why the person, who loved me, hid the relation from everyone even from her close
            friends or simply she had played with my emotions?????????????????????????? Is love related to physical
            aspect of a person or is it related to emotions?????????? Last but not the least: - If someone loves the
            person like me simply because of mercy, am I an object of
            pity????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Do the persons like me have no right to
            love?????????????????? ??????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????? “How it all
            happened? How?” I asked her with tears. “Forget about her dear. She does not deserve you, you will find a
            much better life partner, forget about her once and for all”. “I am in tears Sonam. How can I forget her
            with whom I have spent two years of my life? Why she has done this to me?” I asked with a broken heart.
            “Leave her now dear, think about your life in future. I am feeling guilty, I should not have told you about
            her”, she said with guilt in her heart. “Ok dear, I have to go now as I am not feeling well tonight, bye” I
            said. She replied, “Take care of yourself and close this chapter once and for all dear and please don’t lose
            heart, take care, God bless you”. It was the most despairing moment of my life; even worse than the worst I
            have ever experienced. Even worse than my breakup day. I was in tears, was sleepless the whole night as if
            someone has taken something very precious away from me which is even more precious than my life. I kept
            thinking of the past, the moments spent with her. I was unable to understand what to do. I was like a dead
            person whose soul is out of his body. Sometimes thought of ending life, but destiny desired something else.
            “You have to live, not for yourself but for her, you have to. You must find her wherever she is and with
            whom she is, ask her many questions, ask her that why she had ruined my life. Now, you must ruin her life as
            she had done with you. 4 Part her from her husband, then she would be yours, wake up, wake up, you have to
            do that, you have to get your love at any cost, after all everything is fair in love and war”, devil in me
            kept on telling me to do that. Next day was quite disturbing for me. I had a talk with my close friends.
            They tried to soothe my mind and I felt a little better but not so much. It was the mid of April, generally
            the marriage season and my beloved was also going to be married in the month. I didn’t know the exact date
            but whenever I saw a marriage ceremony it hurt me as I was reminded that my beloved was also going to be
            someone else. It really hurt me and brought tears into my eyes. The ghost of April 2009 haunted me very
            much. It seemed a gift which had been gifted to me by God, is going to be someone else now. Whenever I saw a
            newlywed couple, I was reminded of her which greatly disturbed my mind. I was in dismaying state. Often her
            remembrance haunted me. Her sweet voice, her beautiful smile, her love for me, her promises with me, the
            dreams we had seen together, dreamt of having a beautiful hut in the hill station, me and my beloved living
            a beautiful life where only love prevails, she in my arms and I having an infinite love for her, but all my
            dreams dashed to the ground. My love was in the mortuary and I was collecting the corpse of the time spent
                with her.</p>
